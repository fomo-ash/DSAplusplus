# 🧠 DSA in C++ - My Roadmap

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey using **C++**!  
This repository tracks my progress, primarily based on **Striver’s SDE Sheet**, and extends into **competitive programming** and **advanced topics**.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Master DSA in C++ for coding interviews, placements, and competitive programming by:
- Completing **Striver’s SDE Sheet**
- Practicing problems regularly
- Participating in contests
- Learning advanced concepts beyond the sheet

---

## 🛠️ Phase 1: Setup & C++ Basics
- [ ] Setup IDE / Online Judge (LeetCode, Codeforces, GFG)
- [ ] Learn core C++ syntax
  - [ ] Data types, variables, loops, functions
  - [ ] Arrays, strings, vectors
  - [ ] Input/Output
- [ ] Learn STL (Standard Template Library)
  - [ ] `vector`, `set`, `map`, `pair`
  - [ ] `stack`, `queue`, `priority_queue`
  - [ ] Algorithms: `sort()`, `lower_bound()`, `upper_bound()`
